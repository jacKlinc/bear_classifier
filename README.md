# COVID-19 Mask Detector
Upload a picture of someone to determine whether or not they're wearing a mask. Uses model trained using FastAI and image data retreived via Bing Search API.  

The notebook used to train the model used on streamlit is ```notebooks/mdl_train-mask-classifier.ipynb```. I recommend using a cloud GPU to save time.
